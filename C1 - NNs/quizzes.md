# Course 1

## Week 1

### Video 2

True or false? As explained in this lecture, every input layer feature is interconnected with every hidden layer feature. (T)

### Video 3

Would structured or unstructured data have features such as pixel values or individual words?

Structured data.

Unstructured data. (T)

### Video 4

What will the variable m denote in this course?

Number of hidden layers

Slope

## Week 2

### Video 3

What is the difference between the cost function and the loss function for logistic regression?

They are different names for the same function.

The loss function computes the error for a single training example; the cost function is the average of the loss functions of the entire training set.(T)

The cost function computes the error for a single training example; the loss function is the average of the cost functions of the entire training set.

### Video 4

True or false. A convex function always has multiple local optima. (T)

### Video 8

In this class, what does the coding convention dvar represent?

The derivative of any variable used in the code.

The derivative of input variables with respect to various intermediate quantities.

The derivative of a final output variable with respect to various intermediate quantities. (T)

# Video 9

In this video, what is the simplified formula for the derivative of the losswith respect to z?

a - y (T)

a / (1-a)

a (1 - y)
